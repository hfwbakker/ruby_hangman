NEXT UP:
- Can consider refactoring game to make use of classes, but otherwise it works.


LOG:
--- Saturday July 3, 2021 ---
- Script now properly loads, saves, and reads from save_game file.
- There now is a game loop (while loop) and it is winnable.
- Base logic all there

--- Wednesday June 30, 2021 ---
- Wrote function that writes to a save file as a hash
- Created game loop (function "the_game") where players get the choice to generate a new game or load a saved one.
- Can now write to save game file and read from it, but need to tinker with input type.

--- Tuesday June 29, 2021 ---
- Created repository and README with project outlines.
- Wrote logic that reads 5desk.txt file as an array, filters it for the right word length, and picks a random sample within it.
- Wrote logic that encodes the generated secret word.
